    content: `I went on my dream podcast, but nearly canceled it.

Felt like an imposter the entire day.

754,000 subscribers.
New territory.
I was nervous. Scared.

Self-doubt was loud in my head.
"What if I failed?"

Imposter syndrome doesn't pick favorites. It attacks everyone, especially when you're leveling up.

But I showed up.
And I realized something important:

Confidence isn't the absence of fear.
It's the willingness to do it afraid.

I sat down, took a breath, and just hit record.
It turned out to be one of the best conversations I've ever had.

If you're waiting to feel "ready", you'll be waiting forever.
Do it scared.`

    content: `POV: Building a startup with your friends in London.

I met Lara Acosta on LinkedIn 3 years ago:
- Under 10,000 followers each
- Glorified freelancers grinding it out solo
- No team, no investment... we just had time.

But a lot has changed since then:
- 500K+ combined followers
- Multiple 7-figure businesses
- DMs with people we want to talk with
- Inbound opportunities we have to turn down
- Speaking gigs, partnerships, collabs flowing in.

All because of posting daily LinkedIn content.

This platform is undefeated for those who want to build a profitable online business in 2026 organically.

And yes, LinkedIn has changed massively since we started 3 years ago.
The algorithm's different.
The audience's expectations are different.
The competition's different.

But we just spent the last 3 months figuring out what actually works today.

The new playbook for 2026:
- How to get more reach and views
- How to grow your authority organically
- How to get inbound leads from content.

All still just through content.`

    content: `This is my no.1 tip to fix your low engagement (fast).

I've been using it for 3 years now.

The problem?
40% of posts flop.
Not because they suck.
But because they lack a visual hook.

You need a text-hook (8 words, specific, direct).
But a visual is a hack to make it work every time.

People scan, they don't read.

If you can stop the scroll with an image, you win the attention battle.
Then your content wins the retention battle.

Here is the exact framework I use for my visuals:
1. Big Bold Header (The Promise)
2. Simple diagram or list (The Proof)
3. One key takeaway (The Value)

Stop posting walls of text.
Start treating your LinkedIn posts like mini-magazines.`

Then I started building $1M+ businesses with content...

The difference?
I stopped writing for "everyone" and started writing for "someone".

Most people write content that is:
- Too vague
- Too boring
- Too salesy

I shifted my strategy to:
- Specific problems
- Actionable solutions
- Personal stories

When you write for one specific person, you attract thousands of them.

Here is my 3-step checklist before I hit publish:
1. Is this solving a painful problem?
2. Is the formatting skimmable?
3. Would I share this if I saw it?

If the answer is no, I delete it.
Quality > Quantity usually.
But Quality + Consistency = Unstoppable.`

3 time zones.
47 different problems.
1 shot at winning.

I've never felt pressure like this ever.
was shaking 2 minutes before we went live.
hours spent on calls.
thousands of dollars invested.

everything felt like it was at stake.

and somehow, along all of the stress... it all came together.
our small tech-startup is live.

reminded me so much of how perfection is overrated.
speed is what truly matters.

We launched ugly.
We launched fast.
And we broke records.

If you're building in 2026, stop polishing the doorknob.
Kick the door open.`

(people traveled across the world to tell us this!)

I woke up this morning to a message from someone who flew from Australia to London just to attend our event.
That's 24 hours of flying.

For a LinkedIn meetup.

It hit me: we aren't just building "followers".
We are building a community.
We are building a movement.

Numbers are vanity.
Impact is sanity.

Don't chase the likes.
Chase the lives you can change.

This year, focus on depth, not width.
Go deep with your audience.
Serve them so well they'd fly across the world to say thank you.`

    content: `In 2023, Jake and I started posting on LinkedIn.

We had $0.
No audience.
No connections.

We were just two kids in London with laptops and too much time.

People told us:
"LinkedIn is for old people."
"You're wasting your time."
"Get a real job."

Fast forward to today:
- We run a 7-figure media company.
- We help founders build their brands.
- We travel the world doing what we love.

The crazy part?
We didn't do anything special.
We just showed up every day for 2 years.

Here is the secret:
Most people quit when it gets hard.
Be the person who keeps going.

Consistency isn't sexy.
But it builds empires.`

    content: `The best entrepreneurs I know don't believe in work-life balance.

This advice is flawed in many ways...

But hear me out.
Balance implies stasis.
It implies 50/50.

Building a business requires obsession.
It requires seasons of imbalance.

You cannot build something extraordinary with ordinary effort.

I spoke to a founder who just exited for $50M.
He told me:
"For 3 years, I didn't take a weekend off. Now I can take the rest of my life off."

I'm not saying burn out.
I'm saying choose your hard.

Hard work now.
Or hard life later.

I choose the work.
Who's with me?`

Month 1: The Sponge Phase
- I would consume everything.
- Top creators, newsletters, podcasts.
- I would analyze WHY they are successful.

Month 2: The Loud Phase
- I would comment on 20 posts a day.
- I would post 5 times a week used the frameworks I learned.
- I would DM 5 people a day just to make friends.

Month 3: The Offer Phase
- I would identify one problem I can solve.
- I would build a simple service or product around it.
- I would sell it to my new network.

You don't need luck.
You need a roadmap.
This is it.`

Here's what actually works in 2026...

1. Video is King, but Carousel is Queen.
- Videos build trust (depth).
- Carousels build reach (width).
- You need both.

2. The "3-Line Rule"
- If your first 3 lines don't make them click "see more", you're dead.
- Optimize your hook above all else.

3. Comments > content.
- Your best content is often hidden in the comments section.
- Reply to everyone. Start conversations.

4. Authenticity beats Polish.
- People are tired of AI-generated perfection.
- Be raw. Be real. Be you.

Stop looking for the magic pill.
The work IS the pill.`

It sounds crazy.
It probably was.

But we made a pact:
We weren't leaving until we hit the number.

We ate pizza.
We slept on beanbags.
We coded, we wrote, we called, we sold.

Day 1: $0
Day 3: $12,000
Day 7: $45,000
Day 12: $100,000

When we walked out of that room, we were different people.
We proved to ourselves that constraints create resourcefulness.

You don't need millions in funding.
You need hunger.`

I thought, "Maybe I'm just not cut out for this."
"Maybe I have nothing to say."

But I kept showing up.
Not because I was winning.
But because I promised myself I wouldn't quit.

Yesterday, I crossed 200k followers.
But I'm more proud of the girl who kept posting when she had 200.

Consistency is the only cheat code I know.

- Professional Banner.
- Featured section with social proof.

2. Daily engagement strategy.
- 10 comments on big creators (value add).
- 10 comments on peers (support).
- 5 connection requests with personalized notes.

3. Content Strategy.
- 5x posts per week.
- 2x Carousels (Education).
- 1x Personal Story (Connection).
- 1x Case Study (Authority).
- 1x Contrarian/Opinion (Growth).

4. The "DM" Strategy.
- Network sideways, not just up.
- Build genuine relationships.
- Don't pitch slapping.

It's not about the algorithm.
It's about the people.`
